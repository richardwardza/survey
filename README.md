# survey
API to power a survey/questionnaire tool

This is to be used in combination with something like https://github.com/richardwardza/fe-survey

This is a graphql based api using prisma2 (prisma-client-js) for the database abstraction.

For deployments it uses `serverless` from `serverless.com` to deploy to an AWS environment.

To get it running locally you should need to do something like:

```
yarn
serverless offline
```

.. this README should be update at some stage.
